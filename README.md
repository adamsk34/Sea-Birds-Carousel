This was an academic project. Open [app.htm](app.htm), in your browser, to view the web page.

This was originally made for *COMP3020 Human Computer Interaction 1* class, in fall 2016 at the University of Manitoba.

This uses assets from an old version of my game called **Sea Birds: End of an Age**. I have since remade the game from scratch and released in on Steam [(available here)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/977310/Sea_Birds_End_of_an_Age).
