# Sea-Birds-Old-Carousel
Website Carousel

This was an academic project. Open "new 1.htm" to view the carousel.

I made this for my Human Computer Interaction 1 class. The assignment was
to create a simple carousel of 5 or more pictures. I tried to make it
creative and personal.

This uses assets from an old version of my game called Sea Birds: End of an Age
